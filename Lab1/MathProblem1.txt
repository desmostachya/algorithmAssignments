Math Problem 1. Which of the following functions are increasing? eventually nondecreasing?
If you remember techniques from calculus, you can make use of those.
(1) f(x) = −x^2
(2) f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1
(3) f(x) = x^3 + x

1) f(x) = -x^2  
To determine whether the function is increasing or decreasing, we find the derivative of the function. The derivative of f(x) = -x^2 is f'(x) = -2x.  
- When f'(x) > 0, the function is increasing, and when f'(x) < 0, the function is decreasing.  
- f'(x) = -2x is positive when x < 0 and negative when x > 0. So, the function is increasing when x is negative and decreasing when x is positive.  
Therefore, it is not increasing for the entire domain, but it is eventually nonincreasing for positive x.

2) f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1  
First, find the derivative:  
f'(x) = 2x + 2.  
- For f'(x) > 0, the function is increasing.  
- f'(x) = 2x + 2 is positive when x > -1 and negative when x < -1.  
Therefore, the function is decreasing for x < -1 and increasing for x > -1. It is nondecreasing for x ≥ -1.

3) f(x) = x^3 + x  
The derivative of f(x) = x^3 + x is f'(x) = 3x^2 + 1.  
- The term 3x^2 + 1 is always positive for all x because x^2 ≥ 0 and adding 1 ensures that the derivative is always greater than 0.  
Since f'(x) > 0 for all values of x, this means the function is always increasing. Therefore, f(x) = x^3 + x is increasing for all x.
