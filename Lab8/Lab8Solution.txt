Q1 A.
(a): Can we generate output 325641?

Let’s try to simulate step-by-step, pushing numbers 1 to 6 and popping to match the output.

Target output: 3 2 5 6 4 1

Start with empty stack.

Push 1 → stack: [1]

Push 2 → stack: [1, 2]

Push 3 → stack: [1, 2, 3]

Pop → 3  (match first output)

Pop → 2  (match second output)

Push 4 → stack: [1, 4]

Push 5 → stack: [1, 4, 5]

Pop → 5  (match third output)

Push 6 → stack: [1, 4, 6]

Pop → 6  (match fourth output)

Pop → 4  (match fifth output)

Pop → 1  (match sixth output)

Yes! This works.

Answer: YES, possible
Sequence: S S S X X S S X S X X X

(b): Can we generate output 154623?

Target output: 1 5 4 6 2 3

Let’s try step-by-step:

Push 1 → stack: [1]

Pop → 1  (match first output)

Push 2 → stack: [2]

Push 3 → stack: [2, 3]

Push 4 → stack: [2, 3, 4]

Push 5 → stack: [2, 3, 4, 5]

Push 6 → stack: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Now the stack is [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] (from bottom to top)

Next expected output is 5

Pop → 6  (we needed 5, but top is 6)

We can't skip 6, and since 6 is above 5 in the stack, 5 cannot be popped next.

Answer: NO, not possible
Reason: We must pop 6 before we can reach 5, but 5 is required before 6 in output.

Q1 B.
We are given:

n keys stored in a hash table of size m = n^2

A hash function h is randomly chosen from a universal class H

Let X be the number of collisions

We need to show that the expected number of collisions E[X] < 1/2

Step-by-step solution:
Let’s define a collision as a pair of keys (i, j) such that i ≠ j and h(i) = h(j)

There are total C(n, 2) = n(n - 1) / 2 possible key pairs

For each pair (i, j), let the indicator variable I(i,j) = 1 if h(i) = h(j) 0 otherwise

Since the hash function is chosen from a universal class H, we know: P[h(i) = h(j)] ≤ 1 / m

Let’s define the total number of collisions as:

X = sum over all i < j of I(i,j)

Then the expected number of collisions is:

E[X] = E[sum over all i < j of I(i,j)] = sum over all i < j of E[I(i,j)] = sum over all i < j of P[h(i) = h(j)] ≤ (n(n - 1)/2) * (1 / m)

But m = n^2, so:

E[X] ≤ (n(n - 1)/2) * (1 / n^2) = (n - 1) / (2n)

Now since (n - 1)/(2n) < 1/2 for all n ≥ 1, we get:

E[X] < 1/2

Answer:
The expected number of collisions is less than 1/2

Q2. For each integer n = 1, 2, ..., 7, determine whether there exists a red-black tree having exactly n nodes, with all of them black.

Red-black tree properties (simplified):

Every node is either red or black.

The root is black.

Red nodes cannot have red children (no two red nodes in a row).

Every path from a node to its descendant NULL nodes has the same number of black nodes (called black-height).

We are asked if all nodes can be black. That means:

The tree must satisfy the above properties.

No red node is allowed.

Now check each n from 1 to 7:

n = 1

A single root node (black).

Yes

n = 2

Root is black, one child also black → violates black-height rule (one path has two black nodes, the other has one).

No

n = 3

Root black, two black children → all paths have two black nodes.

Yes

n = 4

Try making root black, two black children, one of those has a black child.

Some paths will have 3 black nodes, some 2 → violates black-height.

No

n = 5

Make a balanced tree: root black, two black children, each with one black child.

All paths have 3 black nodes.

Yes

n = 6

No balanced configuration gives equal black-height with 6 black nodes.

No

n = 7

Full binary tree with black root, 2 black children, each with 2 black children.

All paths have 3 black nodes.

Yes

Final Table:


Num nodes n	Does there exist a red-black tree with n nodes, all of which are black?
1	Yes
2	No
3	Yes
4	No
5	Yes
6	No
7	Yes

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q3. For each integer n = 1, 2, ..., 7, determine whether there exists a red-black tree having exactly n nodes and exactly one red node.

Red-black tree properties recap:

Every node is red or black.

The root must be black.

Red nodes cannot have red children.

All paths from a node to descendant NULL nodes must contain the same number of black nodes.

We're now checking whether it's possible to build a red-black tree with exactly one red node for each n = 1 to 7.

n = 1

Only one node → must be black (root must be black).

No red node possible.

No

n = 2

Root black, one red child → satisfies all rules.

Yes

n = 3

Root black, two children: one red, one black → all paths have same black-height.

Yes

n = 4

Make root black, two black children, one has a red child → only one red node.

Yes

n = 5

Root black, two black children.

One of them has two children — make one red, other black (or NULL).

Yes

n = 6

Balanced tree with exactly one red node → possible.

Yes

n = 7

Full black binary tree (7 nodes), all black → already used in Q2.

Add 1 red node at any valid position while keeping balance → still works.

Yes

Final Table:


Num nodes n    	Does there exist a red-black tree with n nodes that has exactly one red node?
1	              No
2	              Yes
3	              Yes
4	              Yes
5	              Yes
6	              Yes
7	              Yes

Q4. Show the red-black tree that results after inserting: 21, 32, 64, 75, 15

Step-by-step Red-Black Tree insertion with color and rotations:

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Insert 21
------------------------------------------------------------
21(B)

Explanation:
- Tree was empty, so 21 becomes root and is colored black.


------------------------------------------------------------
2. Insert 32
------------------------------------------------------------
   21(B)
        \
        32(R)

Explanation:
- 32 is inserted as red.
- Parent (21) is black → No fix needed.


------------------------------------------------------------
3. Insert 64
------------------------------------------------------------
Before fix:
   21(B)
        \
        32(R)
              \
              64(R)

Violation:
- Two consecutive reds (32 and 64)

Fix:
- Left rotation at 21
- Recolor 32 to black, 21 and 64 to red

After fix:
     32(B)
    /     \
 21(R)   64(R)


------------------------------------------------------------
4. Insert 75
------------------------------------------------------------
Before fix:
     32(B)
    /     \
 21(R)   64(R)
               \
               75(R)

Violation:
- Red parent (64) and red child (75)

Fix:
- Uncle (21) is red → Recolor 21 and 64 to black, 32 to red
- Root (32) must be black

After fix:
     32(B)
    /     \
 21(B)   64(B)
               \
               75(R)


------------------------------------------------------------
5. Insert 15
------------------------------------------------------------
     32(B)
    /     \
 21(B)   64(B)
  /          \
15(R)       75(R)

Explanation:
- 15 is red.
- Parent (21) is black → No fix needed.


------------------------------------------------------------
Final Red-Black Tree
------------------------------------------------------------
     32(B)
    /     \
 21(B)   64(B)
  /          \
15(R)       75(R)
