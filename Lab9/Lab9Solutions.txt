Q1 A)
-------------------

a. Can the sequence 325641 be a valid postorder traversal of a BST?

Given: 3 2 5 6 4 1

In postorder traversal, the last element is the root. Here, root = 1.

All elements before root must satisfy BST rules:
- Left subtree: values < 1
- Right subtree: values > 1

But here, all values before root are > 1, and none are < 1.
This violates the BST property that values in the left subtree must be less than the root.

Therefore, 325641 is NOT a valid postorder traversal of any BST.

Answer: Not possible


b. Can the sequence 154623 be a valid postorder traversal of a BST?

Given: 1 5 4 6 2 3

Root = 3 (last element)

Split the sequence into:
- Left subtree (values < 3): should contain values less than 3
- Right subtree (values > 3): should contain values greater than 3

Looking at the sequence:
- 1 is < 3 ⇒ left
- 5 is > 3 ⇒ should go to right
- But then 4 > 3 appears before 2 < 3, which is invalid in BST postorder.
  Right subtree must contain only values > 3, in postorder format.

Thus, BST property is violated.

Answer:  Not possible

Q1 B)
-------------------

Let n be the number of distinct keys inserted into a BST in random order.

Each key is inserted with comparisons to existing nodes — each such comparison is analogous to a "collision".

Expected number of comparisons for inserting n random keys into a BST is:

  E[C(n)] ≈ n * log n  (on average)

There are a total of n(n-1)/2 possible key pairs.

Expected number of comparisons per key pair is:

  ≈ (n * log n) / (n(n-1)/2) = O(log n / n) < 1/2 (for large n)

Therefore, the expected number of "collisions" (comparisons per pair) is less than 1/2.

Answer:  The expected number of such events is < 1/2
